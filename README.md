  Just a Mountain  :  01_a_mountain
-----

Adds a Mountain during worldgen.

The Mountain is about 1000 blocks high and has a base of a 2000x4000 blocks.

The Position of the mountain can be configured in the settings.

-----

The dafault ore distribution is used to generate ores in the mountain. 

With an unmodified Minetest-basegame, this results in almost no ores in the mountain.

To change this, edit "\games\minetest_game\mods\default\mapgen.lua".


No new blocks/items or functions are added with this mod.

Once the mountain has been fully generated, the mod can be safely romoved again.
