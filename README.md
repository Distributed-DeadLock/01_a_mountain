No new blocks/items or functions are added with this mod.

Once the mountain has been fully generated, the mod can be safely removed again.

-----

The mountain will be build in every game, but only from "mapgen_stone".

Only Minetest_Game and VoxelLibre will produce the mountain with all features.

-----


The dafault ore distribution is used to generate ores in the mountain. 

With an unmodified Minetest-basegame, this results in almost no ores in the mountain.

To change this, edit "\games\minetest_game\mods\default\mapgen.lua".
