No new blocks/items or functions are added with this mod.

The mountains base materials are "mapgen_stone", "mapgen_water_source", "mapgen_snowblock" & "mapgen_ice".

Biome defined materials are used if available.

Once the mountain has been fully generated, the mod can be safely removed again.

-----

Ores in the mountain are generated with both the default ore generator and a mod-specific generator as well. 
The mod specific generator uses all ores that are registered by the game to spawn above an adjustable y-Level (default: -500) as type "scatter". 
Only the "mapgen_stone"-blocks will be transformed to ores, you can adjust the amount of ore-spawning in the settings (with values 0 - 15)
